Introduction
============
This is a **lightweight** and **minimalist** application for
demonstration purposes. It is a console password manager scripted in
Python, with full password encryption using modern algorithms. It
currently supports user creation, password adding and password deleting.

Installation and Usage
======================
Simply clone the repository from `the Github page <https://github.com/vichangelo/pypasswordmanager>`
and run the script *main.py*.

Making of the app
=================
The app uses, besides its own, only modules from the Python standard
libraries. The ``os`` module is used for path functions and random salt
generation, while the ``cryptography`` module is used for the, well,
cryptography functions. The app is based solely on functional programming,
aiming at simplicity and efficiency.
